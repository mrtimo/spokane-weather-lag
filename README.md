# VA SSVF Survey Data Analysis

This repository contains data obtained by the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/), via a [Freedom of Information Act request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/ssvf-satisfaction-surveys/) to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and pre-processed by the Data Liberation Project. 

## Summary of Findings

What did we find? Well let me tell you! With **images**!

## Background and Motivation

Why is this interesting? Why should we be doing this in the first place? What have other people said about this in the news? Why is this relevant?

## Code

This repository contains two Malloy code files:

- [`satisfaction-analysis.malloy`](satisfaction-analysis.malloy), sources all the data tables for the data analysis portion of this repository.
- [`satisfaction-analysis.malloynb`](satisfaction-analysis.malloynb), performs the analysis piece of the data provided by the Data Liberation Project.

## Why Malloy?
[Malloy](https://malloydata.dev) is an open source data language, and a decent alternative to pandas, ggplot, and SQL!
